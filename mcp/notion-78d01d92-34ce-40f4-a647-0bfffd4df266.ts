/**
 * MCP Integration: Notion MCP
 * Server: https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
 *
 * Server Instructions: 
<known-limitations>
IMPORTANT: This Notion integration has the following known limitations:

1. **Cannot trash/delete pages from databases**: You can move pages to other locations (workspace level, other pages, other databases) but cannot directly delete them. If a user explicitly requests to delete/trash a Notion page, you must first confirm with them what their options are:
   - Move the page out of the database to workspace level (removes from database view)
   - Update the page's Status property to mark it as "Done" or another status
   - Move the page to a different parent page or database
   - Have them manually delete it in the Notion UI

2. **File uploads not supported**: The integration does not support uploading files to Notion pages or databases.

3. **Empty Name field limitation**: Database rows that have no value set in the "Name" field (the default title column that cannot be deleted) will not be retrievable. This is a limitation on Notion's side. If users report missing database entries, check if those entries have empty Name fields.

Always confirm which option they prefer before proceeding with any workaround.
</known-limitations>

Use "fetch" tool for full page/database contents after getting search results.
To search within a database: First fetch the database to get the data source URL (collection://...) from <data-source url="..."> tags, then use that as data_source_url. For multi-source databases, match by view ID (?v=...) in URL or search all sources separately.
Don't combine database URL/ID with collection:// prefix for data_source_url. Don't use database URL as page_url.

/** ## Overview
Creates one or more Notion pages, with the specified properties and content.
## Parent
All pages created with a single call to this tool will have the same parent. The parent can be a Notion page ("page_id") or data source ("data_source_id"). If the parent is omitted, the pages are created as standalone, workspace-level private pages, and the person that created them can organize them later as they see fit.
If you have a database URL, ALWAYS pass it to the "fetch" tool first to get the schema and URLs of each data source under the database. You can't use the "database_id" parent type if the database has more than one data source, so you'll need to identify which "data_source_id" to use based on the situation and the results from the fetch tool (data source URLs look like collection://<data_source_id>).
If you know the pages should be created under a data source, do NOT use the database ID or URL under the "page_id" parameter; "page_id" is only for regular, non-database pages.
## Content
Notion page content is a string in Notion-flavored Markdown format.
Don't include the page title at the top of the page's content. Only include it under "properties".
**IMPORTANT**: For the complete Markdown specification, always first fetch the MCP resource at `notion://docs/enhanced-markdown-spec`. Do NOT guess or hallucinate Markdown syntax. This spec is also applicable to other tools like update-page and fetch.
## Properties
Notion page properties are a JSON map of property names to SQLite values.
When creating pages in a database:
- Use the correct property names from the data source schema shown in the fetch tool results.
- Always include a title property. Data sources always have exactly one title property, but it may not be named "title", so, again, rely on the fetched data source schema.

For pages outside of a database:
- The only allowed property is "title",	which is the title of the page in inline markdown format. Always include a "title" property.

**IMPORTANT**: Some property types require expanded formats:
- Date properties: Split into "date:{property}:start", "date:{property}:end" (optional), and "date:{property}:is_datetime" (0 or 1)
- Place properties: Split into "place:{property}:name", "place:{property}:address", "place:{property}:latitude", "place:{property}:longitude", and "place:{property}:google_place_id" (optional)
- Number properties: Use JavaScript numbers (not strings)
- Checkbox properties: Use "__YES__" for checked, "__NO__" for unchecked

**Special property naming**: Properties named "id" or "url" (case insensitive) must be prefixed with "userDefined:" (e.g., "userDefined:URL", "userDefined:id")
## Templates
When creating a page in a database, you can apply a template to pre-populate it with content and property values. Use the "fetch" tool on a database to see available templates in the <templates> section of each data source.
When using a template:
- Pass the template's ID as "template_id" in the page object.
- Do NOT include "content" when using a template, as the template provides it.
- You can still set "properties" alongside the template to override template defaults.
- Template application is asynchronous. The page is created immediately but starts blank; the template content will appear shortly after.

/** ## Overview
Update a Notion page's properties or content.
## Properties
Notion page properties are a JSON map of property names to SQLite values.
For pages in a database:
- ALWAYS use the "fetch" tool first to get the data source schema and the	exact property names.
- Provide a non-null value to update a property's value.
- Omitted properties are left unchanged.

**IMPORTANT**: Some property types require expanded formats:
- Date properties: Split into "date:{property}:start", "date:{property}:end" (optional), and "date:{property}:is_datetime" (0 or 1)
- Place properties: Split into "place:{property}:name", "place:{property}:address", "place:{property}:latitude", "place:{property}:longitude", and "place:{property}:google_place_id" (optional)
- Number properties: Use JavaScript numbers (not strings)
- Checkbox properties: Use "__YES__" for checked, "__NO__" for unchecked

**Special property naming**: Properties named "id" or "url" (case insensitive) must be prefixed with "userDefined:" (e.g., "userDefined:URL", "userDefined:id")
For pages outside of a database:
- The only allowed property is "title",	which is the title of the page in inline markdown format.

## Content
Notion page content is a string in Notion-flavored Markdown format.
**IMPORTANT**: For the complete Markdown specification, first fetch the MCP resource at `notion://docs/enhanced-markdown-spec`. Do NOT guess or hallucinate Markdown syntax.
Before updating a page's content with this tool, use the "fetch" tool first to get the existing content to find out the Markdown snippets to use in the "update_content" command's old_str fields.
### Preserving Child Pages and Databases
When using "replace_content", the operation will check if any child pages or databases would be deleted. If so, it will fail with an error listing the affected items.
To preserve child pages/databases, include them in new_str using `<page url="...">` or `<database url="...">` tags. Get the exact URLs from the "fetch" tool output.
**CRITICAL**: To intentionally delete child content: if the call failed with validation and requires `allow_deleting_content` to be true, DO NOT automatically assume the content should be deleted. ALWAYS show the list of pages to be deleted and ask for user confirmation before proceeding.
## Examples
		<example description="Update page properties">
		{
			"page_id": "f336d0bc-b841-465b-8045-024475c079dd",
			"command": "update_properties",

				}

		}
		</example>
## Templates
You can apply a template to an existing page using the "apply_template" command. The template content is appended to the page asynchronously. Get template IDs from the <templates> section in the fetch tool results for a database, or use any page ID as a template.
		<example description="Apply a template to an existing page">
		{
			"page_id": "f336d0bc-b841-465b-8045-024475c079dd",
			"command": "apply_template",
			"template_id": "a5da15f6-b853-455d-8827-f906fb52db2b"
		}
		</example>
## Verification
You can verify or unverify a page using the "update_verification" command. Verification marks a page as reviewed and up-to-date. Requires a Business or Enterprise plan (or the page must be in a wiki).
		<example description="Verify a page for 90 days">
		{
			"page_id": "f336d0bc-b841-465b-8045-024475c079dd",
			"command": "update_verification",
			"verification_status": "verified",
			"verification_expiry_days": 90
		}
		</example>
		<example description="Verify a page indefinitely">

		}
